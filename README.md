Student Enrollment Form

Title of the Project:
Student Enrollment Form using JsonPowerDB

Description:
The Student Enrollment Form is a web-based application that allows users to store and manage student information in a database. This application is built using JsonPowerDB, a high-performance, schema-free, NoSQL database that supports CRUD operations, multiple data types, and indexing. The form has input fields for Roll No., Full Name, Class, Birth Date, Address, and Enrollment Date. The Roll No. field serves as the primary key for the STUDENT-TABLE relation in the SCHOOL-DB database.

Benefits of using JsonPowerDB:

High performance: JsonPowerDB uses a unique indexing algorithm that enables lightning-fast search and retrieval of data.
Easy to use: JsonPowerDB is a schema-free database, meaning you can start using it right away without any prior knowledge of database design or administration.
Low maintenance: JsonPowerDB requires minimal configuration and maintenance, making it a cost-effective solution for small to medium-sized applications.
Flexible data types: JsonPowerDB supports multiple data types, including strings, numbers, arrays, and objects, making it a versatile database for different types of applications.
Real-time data: JsonPowerDB supports real-time data synchronization and replication, ensuring that your data is always up to date.

Release History:
Version 1.0 (April 2023): Initial release of the Student Enrollment Form using JsonPowerDB on Github.
